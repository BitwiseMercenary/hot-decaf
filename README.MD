### Hot Decaf

Brew some hot decaf right now. A library for decaffeinating coffeescript files, transpiling it, then returning
the result as a module. A cleaning closure is also returned to remove the transpiled
code if desired.

The `/examples` directory contains references for ways to `brew` some decaffeinated JS.
